# Phalanx — Future Enhancements

Ideas and deferred mechanics that are **not part of v1**. These are captured
here so they are not lost, but none of them should block the core game from
being playable and testable.

## Joker Card

The Joker has 0 attack and 0 defense value, no suit, and no suit bonuses. It
is considered a "Wild" card. The specific Wild mechanic is undefined.

Ideas for the Wild mechanic:
- Copy the suit/rank of an adjacent card
- Act as a wildcard during deployment (player chooses its effective suit)
- Sacrifice to draw additional cards
- Absorb one lethal hit then discard itself

The Joker is excluded from the 52-card deck in v1. Games use a standard deck
without Jokers.

**Related rule IDs:** PHX-CARDS-004, PHX-CARDS-002 (Joker value 0)

## Face-Down Cards

Cards in the drawpile and discard pile are face-down. A future mechanic could
place cards face-down on the battlefield (neither player sees the value). The
face-down card still occupies its grid position and can be targeted. When it
takes damage or is otherwise revealed, it flips face-up before the effect
resolves.

No specific trigger for face-down battlefield placement is defined yet.

Ideas:
- Deploy the last 1-2 cards face-down during deployment
- A special card ability that flips a card face-down
- Reinforcement from the drawpile arrives face-down

**Related rule ID:** PHX-CARDS-003

## Multi-Player (3+ Players)

The grid layout is designed for head-to-head play. A future expansion could
support 3+ players with adjusted grid sizes or a shared battlefield.

## Other Ideas

- Heroical trait (face card hand-swap mechanic)
- Heroical defeats Ace (J/Q/K bypass Ace invulnerability)
- Player name display in waiting room
- Mobile responsive layout
- Match history / replay viewer
- Ranked matchmaking
- Card animations and sound effects
- Spectator mode
