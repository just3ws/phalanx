# The Rules of Engagement

<p class="small-note">This page is a scannable overview. The canonical draft rules are in the main repository.</p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Your Objective</h2>
  <p>Your goal in Phalanx is to overwhelm your opponent. You'll deploy cards into a tactical formation and attack in columns, aiming to break through their lines and reduce their Life Points (LP) to zero. Victory can also be claimed if your opponent cannot draw or reinforce, running out of cards completely.</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Rank</th><th>Value</th></tr>

    <h2>Paths to Victory</h2>
    <p>Most games end when one player's LP is depleted from overwhelming attacks. However, a long, strategic duel can also end by exhausting your opponent's deck, leaving them unable to fight back.</p>

  <h2>Anatomy of a Turn</h2>
  <ol class="quick-list">
    <li>Attack with a card from your front row.</li>
    <li>Resolve the attack down the opposing column: front card, then back card, then player LP.</li>
    <li>Apply powerful suit effects (see Suits & Strategy).</li>
    <li>Reinforce any open positions in your formation.</li>
    <li>The turn passes to your opponent.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>The Art of Formation</h2>
  <p>Your front row is your shield and your spearhead. The back row provides support, weathers the overflow from battles, and prepares to step into the fight. Mastering this rotation is key to victory.</p>
