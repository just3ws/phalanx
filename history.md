# History

<section class="card">
  <h2>Where Phalanx Started</h2>
  <p>Phalanx began as a physical card-combat concept explored through notebook sketches and tabletop prototypes in 2022. Early design work focused on rows, column pressure, and suit-driven combat identity.</p>
  <p class="small-note">Historical archives on this page are for project history only. Canonical current rules remain in the primary repository documentation.</p>

  <h2>Evolution Timeline</h2>
  <ul class="quick-list">
    <li><strong>July 9, 2022:</strong> initial commit in the primary Phalanx repository.</li>
    <li><strong>July 10-16, 2022:</strong> notebook scans, tools photos, suit notes, deployment and gameplay basics documented.</li>
    <li><strong>July 11, 2022:</strong> project renamed from Panoplia to Phalanx.</li>
    <li><strong>July-August 2022:</strong> legacy Ruby implementation explored battle logic and test-driven combat behavior.</li>
