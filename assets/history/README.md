# Historical Assets Archive

This folder stores historical reference artifacts copied from earlier Phalanx repositories.

Important:
- These files are archived for project history and storytelling.
- They are **not** canonical rule sources for current gameplay.
- Canonical rules live in the primary repository: `docs/RULES.md`.

## Source Buckets

- `primary/`: copied from `/Users/mike/github.com/just3ws/phalanx`
- `legacy/`: copied from `/Users/mike/github.com/just3ws/phalanx-ruby`

## Provenance

- Primary artifacts include early notebook scans, tabletop photos, and scratch resource files.
- Legacy artifacts include Ruby implementation snippets that informed historical combat logic experiments.

## Canonical Policy

When conflicts exist between archived materials and modern docs, prefer:
1. `/Users/mike/github.com/just3ws/phalanx/docs/RULES.md`
2. `/Users/mike/github.com/just3ws/phalanx/docs/HOWTOPLAY.md`
